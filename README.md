## Abstract

Time is an important factor in many sides of our life. Upon seconds many things can change . Obviously , the medical field is one of the most , if not the most, fields that depends on time as a main factor. For example , in medical operations , patient treatment and emergency medical services .Emergency medical services depend on time with a high percentage . Because it includes delivering the patient into the medical institution (e.g.hospital) to take actions with him. Every second is important, especially with patients who have serious diseases like heart diseases . So, it is a serious problem especially in Egypt .This problem can be solved by **reducing the time** in the stages of the ambulance services process as much as possible . Nowadays new technologies have arisen. We build the solution upon specific design requirements which our solution must achieve to be effective and efficient. Our solution contains **hardware** and **software** that help the paradigmatic and the medical institution to make the time of the ambulance services process to the minimum extent to save the life of the patient . Such as ,preparing the ER **(emergency room)** , make needs for the patient treatment ready and announcing the doctor. After many tests, our solution showed great results and achieved the design requirements very accurately and precisely.
